				<h1>Ruby Identifiers</h1>
				<p>Notes and take aways while reading The Well-Grounded Rubyist by David A. Black.</p>

						<h1>The Identifier Family Tree</h1>
						<h2>Variables</h2>
						<p><strong>Local </strong>x, string, __abc__, start_value, and firstName</p>
						<ul><li>Local variables start with a lowercase letter or an underscore and consist of letters, underscores, and/ or digits.<li></ul>
						<p><strong>Instance </strong>@age, @last_name</p>
						<ul><li>Instance variables serve the purpose of storing information for individual objects. Instance variables always start with a single at-sign and consist thereafter of the same character set as local variables.</li></ul>
						<p><strong>Class </strong>@@running_total</p>
						<ul><li>Class variables store information per class hierarchy and follow the same rules as instance variables, ecept that they start with two at-signs.</li></ul>
						<p><strong>Global </strong>$population</p>
						<ul><li>Global variables are recognizable by their leading dollar sign. The segment after the dollar sign doesn't follow local-variable naming conventions; there are global variables called $:, $1, and $/, as well as $stdin and $LOAD_PATH. Non-alphanumeric global variables are usually predefined, so you don't need to worry about which punctuation marks are legal.</ul></li>
						<h2>Constants</h2>
						<p><strong>Constants </strong>A, String, FirstName, and STDIN</p>
						<ul><li>Constants begin with an uppercase letter. It's customary to use either camelcase or underscore-separated all-uppercase-words in composing constant names from multiple words.</li></ul>
						<h2>Keywords</h2>
						<p><strong>class </strong>For Class Definitions</p>
						<p><strong>def </strong>For Method Definitions</p>
						<p><strong>if </strong>Conditional Execution</p>
						<p><strong>__FILE__ </strong>The Name of the File Currently Being Execute</p>
						<ul><li>Ruby has numerous keywords, about 40 of them, and they're generally short, single-word (as opposed to underscore-composed) indentifiers.</li></ul>
						<h2>Method Names</h2>
						<p><strong>Method Names </strong>x?, string!, __abc__, start_value, and firstName</p>
						<ul><li>Names of methods in Ruby follow the same rules and conventions as local variables (except that they can end with ?, !, or =). This is by design, methods don't call attention to themselves as methods but rather blend into the texture of a program as, simply, expressions that provide a value. In some contexts you can't tell, just by looking at an expression, whether you're seeing a local variable or a method name-and that's intentional.</ul></li>

						<h1>Language Semantics</h1>
						<h2>Method Calls, Messages, and Ruby Objects</h2>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Objects </strong>Ruby sees all data structures and values including integers and strings, and also including complex data structures (like arrays) as objects. Every object is capable of understanding a certain set of messages. Each message that an object understands corresponds directly to a <em>method</em>.</li>
							<li><strong>Method </strong> a named, executable routine whose execution the object has the ability to trigger.</li>
							<li><strong>Object Representation </strong>Objects are represented either by literal constructors-like "quotation marks" for strings, or by variables to which they have been bound.</li>
							<li><strong>Message Sending </strong> is achieved via the special dot operator (the message to the right fo the dot is sent to the object on the left of the dot).</li>
						</ul>
